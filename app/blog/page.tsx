        Hey , I am
        <span className="text-2xl font-semibold"> Denis Mutinda</span>
        &nbsp;â€”&nbsp;a passionate front-end developer with a knack for crafting
        seamless user interfaces. With three years of experience in the field,
        I&apos;ve worked my way up from junior roles to becoming a lead
        developer, honing my skills along the way at Prism.fm and through
        independent projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl mb-5 ">
        I love collaborating on exciting projects, building beautiful,
        functional apps, and constantly finding ways to improve both the user
        experience and developer workflow. Whether it&apos;s bringing ideas to
        life with clean, intuitive code or optimizing processes to make life
        easier for everyone involved, I&apos;m all in.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl mb-5 ">
        Currently, I&apos;m developing engaging web experiences at Taifa-Casino,
        a rising startup in Kenya&apos;s online betting scene. When I&apos;m not
        doing that, you can find me working on my own creative projects under
        DenisWritesCode and Caesius Agency.
      </p>

        Take a look at my portfolio to see some of my work. If you&apos;d like
        to connect or have an interesting project in mind, don&apos;t hesitate
        to reach out.
